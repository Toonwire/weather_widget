## Weather widget
A small widget for fetching and displaying basic weather information.

This project consists of a React SPA, which handles user interaction and displays weather information.
And a Node.js middleware API to introduce some server-side control to the available weather information, 
as well as to hide API keys.

#### Disabling JavaScript
When running with noscripts enabled, the React frontend application will perform a silent redirect to the nodejs server.
